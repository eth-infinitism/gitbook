# 🧠 Smart Accounts

Smart accounts are smart contract-based wallets that serve as the foundation of Account Abstraction (AA). Unlike EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts), which rely on one master private key and ECDSA only protocol-level signature checks, smart accounts embed custom logic for authentication, authorization, network fee payment, nonce management and execution.

Through the ERC-4337 standard, AA unlocks powerful UX and security features without compromising on decentralization and censorship resistance.

## ⭐️ Core Capabilities

Smart accounts can:
* Use custom signature schemes (e.g. passkeys, multisig, guardians)
* Authorize batched and conditional actions
* Utilize Paymasters to either pay network fees using ERC-20 tokens or even have them subsidized by a third party
* Delegate actions with session keys
* Auto-deploy themselves on first use (`initCode`)
* And more

This flexibility makes them ideal for DeFi, DAOs, games, and more.

## 📐 Architecture

Each smart account is a contract that:
- Implements a `validateUserOp()` function for on-chain validation, simulated off-chain by bundlers
- Interacts with the **EntryPoint** contract for validation and execution
- May use internal modules (via standards like ERC-6900 or 7579)

Smart accounts don’t need to exist at first — they can be deterministically deployed with `initCode`, using a factory contract and CREATE2.

## 🔄 Stateless Design

Smart accounts often:
- Are deployed only on first use (counterfactual instantiation)
- Use `nonce` and `initCode` fields in the UserOperation
- Don’t require ETH for deployment or gas if a Paymaster sponsors the operation — Paymasters must stake and conform to validation rules

This makes onboarding frictionless: just sign a transaction and your account is live.

## 🛠 Upgradeability and Custom Logic

Depending on design:
- Some smart accounts are immutable (minimal proxies)
- Others use upgradeable patterns
- Logic can be extended via plugins, hooks, or modules

Security audits and upgrade policies become critical at scale.

## ✅ Summary

Smart accounts are programmable wallets that support richer UX and security than EOAs. They’re the cornerstone of Account Abstraction, built on standards like ERC-4337 and integrated with modular features like session keys and gas abstraction.
